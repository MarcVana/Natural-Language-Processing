Simple, short project based on Yelp dataset (from Kaggle) which uses TF-IDF, Pipeline, MultinomialNB and RandomForestClassifier.

Evaluation is simple, just with a classification report and a confusion matrix. The pipeline model predicted worse (with almost 10%). I used only the reviews with 1 or 5 stars.
Some plots are created for a better understanding of the dataset.
